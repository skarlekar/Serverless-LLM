MVP1 is a serverless application that accepts a large body of text from the user and extracts structured knowledge identifying objects, entities, locations and their relationship between each other from the given unstructured text using a Large Language Model (LLM). 

The structured knowledge will be generated by the LLM in form of a JSON that will be used to render a D3.js force-directed graph. The logic for the application is as follow:

1. A Streamlit Python application will accept the user input using a chat module. The chat module will have Memory Buffer enabled for it to remember the conversation.
2. The Streamlit application will call a Titan LLM model using AWS Bedrock runtime.
3. The prompt for the LLM model will contain instructions to extract entities and relationships in JSON format. The format of the output JSON will be provided in the prompt to specify the D3.js force-directed graph with nodes, links and groups.
4.  The JSON response from the LLM will be used to render a D3.js force-directed graph in the Streamlit application.
